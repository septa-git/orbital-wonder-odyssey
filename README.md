# orbital wonder odyssey

"orbital wonder odyssey" is a solar system project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project presents an engaging visual representation of the solar system, where users can interact with planets by hovering over their orbits or clicking on them to access detailed information.

The web page features animated orbits and interactive buttons for each planet. When hovered over, the planet's orbit stops, and when clicked, detailed information about the planet is displayed. This model creates a unique experience by compressing one Earth year into 10 seconds.

The project not only provides a visual understanding of the relative positions and sequence of planets but also offers detailed information about each planet, including descriptions, planet types, one-way light time to the Sun, distance from the Sun, and the length of the planet's year.
